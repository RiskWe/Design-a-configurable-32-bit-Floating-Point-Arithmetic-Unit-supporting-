# Design-a-configurable-32-bit-Floating-Point-Arithmetic-Unit-supporting-
Design a configurable 32 bit Floating Point Arithmetic Unit supporting the following: Single Precision FP Addition/Subtraction Single Precision FP Multiplication/Division You need to follow IEEE 754-2008 standard.  The newest standard is IEEE 754-2019.  For SP FP. 754-2008 should be sufficient.
